    {
      title: "Understanding the Basics",
      content: `<p>Building an airplane is an ambitious and rewarding project that combines knowledge, skill, and passion. Before you dive into the hands-on work, it's crucial to understand the basic principles of aviation and the fundamental components of an airplane. This chapter will provide you with the foundational knowledge necessary for a successful build.</p><p></p><h3>How Airplanes Fly</h3><p>At the heart of aviation are the principles of flight, which explain how airplanes stay in the air. Four main forces act upon an airplane: lift, thrust, drag, and weight. Understanding these forces is essential for designing and building an aircraft that flies safely and efficiently.</p><p></p><p><strong>Lift:</strong> Lift is the force that allows an airplane to rise into the air. It is generated by the wings as they move through the air. The shape of the wings, known as an airfoil, creates a difference in air pressure above and below the wing, resulting in lift. The faster the wings move through the air, the greater the lift produced.</p><p></p><p><strong>Thrust:</strong> Thrust is the force that propels an airplane forward. It is generated by the airplane's engine, which can be a piston engine, jet engine, or electric motor. Thrust must overcome drag for the airplane to accelerate and maintain flight.</p><p></p><p><strong>Drag:</strong> Drag is the resistance an airplane encounters as it moves through the air. It is caused by the friction and turbulence created by the airplane's surface and shape. Minimizing drag is crucial for improving the airplane's performance and fuel efficiency.</p><p></p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> Weight is the force of gravity acting on the airplane. It pulls the airplane toward the Earth and must be balanced by lift for the airplane to ascend and remain airborne. Proper weight distribution and control are vital for stable flight.</p><p></p><h3>Basic Aerodynamics</h3><p>Aerodynamics is the study of how air interacts with solid objects, such as an airplane. Understanding basic aerodynamic principles will help you design and build an airplane that flies smoothly and efficiently.</p><p><strong>Airfoil Shape:</strong> The shape of the wings, or airfoil, is critical in generating lift. The upper surface of the airfoil is curved, while the lower surface is flatter. This shape causes the air to move faster over the top of the wing, creating lower pressure and generating lift.</p><p></p><p><strong>Angle of Attack:</strong> The angle of attack is the angle between the wing's chord line (a straight line from the leading edge to the trailing edge) and the oncoming airflow. Increasing the angle of attack increases lift, but too high an angle can lead to a stall, where the airflow separates from the wing and lift is lost.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stability and Control:</strong> Stability refers to an airplane's ability to maintain steady flight without constant control inputs. Control involves the airplane's ability to change its flight path using control surfaces like ailerons, elevators, and the rudder. Proper balance and design of these elements ensure a stable and controllable airplane.</p><p></p><h3>Components of an Airplane</h3><p>An airplane is made up of several key components, each serving a specific purpose. Understanding these components will help you in the construction process and ensure that your airplane is built correctly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fuselage:</strong> The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It houses the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. The fuselage must be strong enough to withstand the forces of flight while being as lightweight as possible.</p><p></p><p><strong>Wings:</strong> The wings generate lift and support the weight of the airplane during flight. They also house the ailerons and flaps, which are control surfaces that help the airplane maneuver.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tail Assembly:</strong> The tail assembly, or empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer, elevators, vertical stabilizer, and rudder. These components provide stability and control in pitch and yaw directions.</p><p></p><p><strong>Landing Gear:</strong> The landing gear supports the airplane on the ground and absorbs the impact during landing. It can be fixed or retractable, depending on the design and purpose of the airplane.</p><p></p><p><strong>Engine:</strong> The engine provides the thrust needed for flight. It can be a piston engine, turbine engine, or electric motor. The engine's power and efficiency are crucial for the airplane's performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cockpit Instruments:</strong> The cockpit is equipped with various instruments that provide the pilot with essential information for flight, such as airspeed, altitude, heading, and engine performance. Proper installation and calibration of these instruments are vital for safe operation.</p><p></p><p>By understanding the basics of how airplanes fly and the components that make up an aircraft, you are now equipped with the knowledge to begin planning and building your own airplane. In the next chapter, we will delve into the planning process, including choosing a design, gathering materials, and ensuring safety throughout your project.</p><p></p><hr>`,

    {
      title: "Vitamin A: Vision and Beyond",
      content: `<p>Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient that plays a vital role in maintaining vision, supporting the immune system, and promoting cell growth. It exists in two primary forms: preformed vitamin A, found in animal products, and provitamin A carotenoids, found in colorful fruits and vegetables. Understanding the functions and sources of vitamin A can help ensure you meet your body's needs for this essential nutrient.</p><p></p><h4>The Role of Vitamin A in Vision</h4><p></p><p>One of the most well-known functions of vitamin A is its role in maintaining healthy vision. It is a key component of rhodopsin, a protein in the retina that absorbs light and supports low-light and color vision. Without adequate vitamin A, the eyes cannot produce enough rhodopsin, leading to night blindness and other vision problems. Additionally, vitamin A helps maintain the cornea, the eye's outermost layer, ensuring it remains clear and free of damage.</p><p></p><h4>Immune System Support</h4><p></p><p>Vitamin A is also critical for the proper functioning of the immune system. It helps maintain the integrity of skin and mucous membranes, which act as barriers to bacteria and viruses. By keeping these barriers strong, vitamin A helps prevent infections. It also plays a role in the production and function of white blood cells, which are essential for fighting off pathogens and infections.</p><p></p><h4>Promoting Cell Growth and Differentiation</h4><p></p><p>Beyond vision and immunity, vitamin A is essential for cell growth and differentiation. It supports the normal functioning of cells in various tissues throughout the body, including the skin, lungs, intestines, and heart. By promoting healthy cell growth and differentiation, vitamin A contributes to the proper development and maintenance of organs and tissues.</p><p></p><h4>Sources of Vitamin A</h4><p></p><p>To ensure adequate intake of vitamin A, include a variety of foods in your diet. Animal sources of preformed vitamin A include liver, dairy products, and fish. Plant sources of provitamin A carotenoids include carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, kale, and other leafy greens. Brightly colored fruits and vegetables, such as mangoes and apricots, are also rich in carotenoids.</p><p></p><h4>Balancing Vitamin A Intake</h4><p></p><p>While it is important to consume enough vitamin A, it is equally important not to consume too much. Excessive intake of preformed vitamin A, typically from supplements, can lead to toxicity, causing symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, and even more severe health issues. Carotenoids from plant sources, however, do not pose the same risk of toxicity, as the body regulates their conversion to vitamin A based on its needs.</p><p></p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p></p><p>Vitamin A is indispensable for vision, immune function, and cell growth. By incorporating a diverse range of vitamin A-rich foods into your diet, you can support these critical bodily functions and maintain overall health. Whether through a colorful array of fruits and vegetables or nutrient-dense animal products, ensuring a balanced intake of vitamin A is key to reaping its numerous health benefits.</p>`,

return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input {...register('name', { required: true })} /&gt;
        {errors.name &amp;&amp; &lt;span&gt;This field is required&lt;/span&gt;}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;

import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

const AdvancedForm = () =&gt; {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm();

return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input
          {...register('username', {
            required: 'Username is required',
            minLength: {
              value: 3,
              message: 'Username must be at least 3 characters long'
            }
          })}
        /&gt;
        {errors.username &amp;&amp; &lt;span&gt;{errors.username.message}&lt;/span&gt;}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input
          type="password"
          {...register('password', {
            required: 'Password is required',
            validate: (value) =&gt;
              value.length &gt;= 6 || 'Password must be at least 6 characters long'
          })}
        /&gt;
        {errors.password &amp;&amp; &lt;span&gt;{errors.password.message}&lt;/span&gt;}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
};

export default AdvancedForm;</code></pre><p>In this example:</p><ul><li><p>Custom validation rules are added using the <code>register</code> function.</p></li><li><p>Error messages are displayed based on the validation rules.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>React Hook Form is a powerful library for managing forms in React applications.
